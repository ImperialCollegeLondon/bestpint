A proof of concept web app to get data from Epicollect+ Bestpint project and display data on a map. A bit slow to get data as it uses a proxy due to Epicollect+ security settings. Data can be collected either using the Epicollect+ mobile app (Android only), or using the Bestpint mobile app for both Android and iOS

Master branch uses Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMaps to render map and markers

Working on a Google Maps and Open Layers implementations
